-- RED Reactive Counterpressure
-- ============================================================================
-- RED Reactive Counterpressure (simple explanation):
-- When BLUE players get close to RED frontline zones, RED starts reacting.
-- RED reaction has 2 parts:
-- 1) Soft reaction: RED speeds up some supply and Patrolling CAP groups for pressured RED zones.
-- 2) Hard reaction: RED can force-spawn attack groups to strike BLUE zones.
-- If you do NOT want red supplies groups to be boosted in speed to spawn faster, set softSupplyBoostPerZone to 0.
-- If you do NOT want red CAP groups to be boosted in speed to spawn faster, set softCapBoostPerZone to 0.
